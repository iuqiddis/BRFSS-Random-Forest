# Using Random Forest Classificaiton to Predict Good or Poor Health Based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a real world dataset (RWD) compiled from an annual health-related telephone survey conducted by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services [CDC's BRFSS site].

The resultant public domain datasets are readily avaliable via the CDC's site. The datasets typically consist of appromixtely 300,000 to 400,000 surveyed individuals, with about 250 to 350 variables (mapping to asked behavioral questions or calculated variables).

Goal: The goal for this data project is to to use one of the annual BRFSS datasets to make a predictive classification model to determine whether a subject would be categorized in 'Good or Better' health or 'Fair or Poor' health based on the survey findings.
